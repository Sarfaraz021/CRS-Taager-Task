Hello, peace be upon you. Welcome, my sister. What we eat, we eat. No, that's it, we eat. I am present in the area where I am not present in the order area. Who is present? Okay, can I place the order for you, brother, to your listed address? What can I place for you? Okay, fine, exist. No, no, I am present. I went to Syria. I went to Syria. Yes, at your service. I would like to guide her to you when you come back. Hopefully, it's good. I went and canceled. I went out and came back again at your service. I will request an order from Fahmi Store under the name of my brother Ammar Mohammed Al-Zain, an order for a Shiniur 25 by 209 riyals. Yes, okay, brother. If an incident happens, can I place it for you when you come back? I'm not sure when, a month, two months, 15. No one can deliver it. I'm talking to you all. I'm not in a hurry, I'm talking to you. Okay, at your service. Goodbye. Thank you all.
