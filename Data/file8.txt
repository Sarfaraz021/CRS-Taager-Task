Hey, transcribe this:

Brother Mohammed, I'm contacting you regarding an order I was discussing with you. It's about the children's electric car with 380 watts, priced at 365 riyals, correct?

Yes, that's correct, Mohammed. I'm getting in touch to confirm the order. So, should I confirm the order now?

Alright, what colors do you have?

What? What?

The car colors, what are they?

There's red and white.

Only those two colors?

Yes, those are the only available colors right now.

Okay, is there no pink or light color available? Are these meant for girls?

Yes, yes, the red one could be nice for her. Okay, and there's no pink or mauve available?

No, sorry, those are the only two colors available in front of me, red and white. This is a new car this time, meaning when? When you drive it, it doesn't have speed or anything?

No, it doesn't have speed. Yes, it's for children, plus it has lights, like pink and blue and stuff, so it suits girls as well.

Alright, up to what age is this car suitable?

One moment, from what age?

From two to ten years old.

Okay, nice. For a girl about seven years old, would it be suitable for her?

Of course. Please confirm the red one for me.

The red one?

Yes, because the white is more for boys, not girls.

Alright, can I have a moment to check your details and address?

Okay, no problem. Go ahead.

I need another mobile number for contact: 0500511307.

Perfect. Are you located in Tabuk, at Taima?

Yes, it's an area, but we're living in Taima now, which is part of Tabuk originally.

In Al-Ghbwa neighborhood, on Arraf Al-Kindi Street.

Which street?

Arraf Al-Kindi Street.

Yes, okay. I see Taima, in Al-Tijari neighborhood, and Ka'a and Hadaj Park. Are you near any of these?

I'm near the park. They're all close to each other anyway.

Alright, can you give me any nearby landmark for you?

Okay, there's the Al-Shifa Health Center where I work.

The Al-Shifa Health Center?

Yes, alright. The order should arrive to you within two to three working days. Our representative works daily from 9 AM to 9 PM and will contact you two hours before arrival, alright?

Yes, good, God willing. So, how many days will it take to arrive?

Hopefully, two to three days. Thank you so much. Where are you located, in Jeddah or where?

No, we're in Riyadh, in the Marsala neighborhood.

Okay, thank you, sister.
