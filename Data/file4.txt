Hello, peace be upon you.

Peace be upon you too. Good evening, my sister. This is Mays from the order confirmation department. I'm reaching out to you, sister Mashael Abdulrahman, regarding your order. Is this a good time to talk?

I registered my time for five days, yes. I'm in contact with you.

Are we in the same country regarding the German blender?

Yes, yes, regarding the order we requested.

Do you want your order delivered after five days because you won’t be available?

Yes, five days. No one from the house can receive it for you?

No, after how many days will it arrive? Are you in Tabuk?

No, I am not in the same country; we are traveling. You know it's vacation time. Are you traveling outside the kingdom?

No, no, within the kingdom. I am currently in the Tabuk area, in Haql.

Do you want to receive your order? We deliver all over the kingdom.

You can deliver my order?

No, it’s okay. I’ll wait five days for it to be in the same city I am in.

Well, just to inform you, the section was offering it at 189 riyals instead of 200 riyals. With a 30% discount on any other product you prefer, and this offer was available for two days. I asked if you can receive your order at your address instead of delaying, so you don’t miss the offer.

I want the offer. The offer is for 200 riyals, correct?

200? Per unit for 200 riyals, correct?

Yes, yes.

Okay, yes, we got the message. It wasn't 200. Hello?

Sister Mashael, can you hear me?

Yes, I hear you now. The offer includes a blender, grinder, and chopper for 200 riyals.

Hello?

Hello, peace be upon you.

Peace be upon you too. The offer for the three pieces is 200 riyals.

Yes, cash on delivery, right?

As you prefer. There’s an option for installments without any interest and online payment on delivery.

All right, I just informed you that we have an additional discount on this offer, lowered during Ramadan to 188 riyals instead of 200 riyals. You get a 30% discount on any other product you add to your order.

This offer is for the blender?

Yes, the blender, grinder, and meat chopper together.

Yes, this is why I asked if you can receive your order at your address, so you don’t miss out.

No, no, it's fine. We accessed the website and placed an order. They said they would contact us within 24 hours.

But I’m contacting you.

Yes, we want to confirm the order.

Do you want to confirm the order?

Yes, we want to confirm the order.

You said you'd delay it for five days to receive it at your address.

No, once your order is confirmed, it will be dispatched to the shipping company and will arrive within a day or two.

You said you are available, so I asked if you want to receive it at the address you are currently at.

Okay, yes, to the address I am currently at.

Can you give me the address you are currently at in Haql?

Haql? Al-Dhahrah neighborhood.

Al-Dhahrah neighborhood?

Al-Dhahrah, Al-Dhahrah.

In Al-Dhahrah?

Yes.

Okay, the order will reach your address within two to three working days from 9 AM to 9 PM.

The courier will contact you an hour before to confirm the scheduled delivery.

Okay, okay, okay, fine, yes, okay. Is this mobile number active?

No, the mobile number is active.

Yes, yes, okay, okay.

What products?

No, just the blender, or okay, no, thank you.

Tahlia Street.

Tahlia Street?

Yes, the public hospital.

No, no, the numbers. Don’t repeat, no. I didn't understand you.
