Hello, Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum, my dear brother. This is Qasim Mohammed from the Order Confirmation Department. How are you doing, dear? I hope you're well. May God bless you. I'm fine, thanks to God. Qasim, is now a good time for you, or would you prefer to communicate later? No, no, everything is fine. I have an order under the name of my brother Ibrahim Shouqi for a teeth whitening product with the price of 125 Riyals. I'm reaching out to review some data and details. Is this okay, or would you prefer to talk later? No, it's fine now, of course.

Could you tell me your address, please? I am in Mecca, in Al-Waleed Al-Ahd 6. Is it in Mecca itself or in another province? No, it’s in Mecca Province, in the Al-Ahd 6 area, behind the Saudi-German Hospital. Is that correct? Yes, that’s a hospital, of course.

Do you have another contact number in case there is any issue with this number? No, this number is working. Alright, let me clarify the warranty for you. Your warranty will be for 7 days against manufacturing defects and shipping before using personal care products. You can return it by scanning the code attached inside the package and delivering the order to the nearest branch of the Dawzon company. This company is responsible for after-sales services. They use WhatsApp from another number, 928, available 24/7 for any inquiry, whether before or after receiving the product.

This product, from personal experience, is very good. It removes yellowing resulting from tea, coffee, or cigarettes and also maintains healthy gums. It's 100% natural with no artificial substances at all. Are the results fast, or does it require repeated use? The difference will be noticeable from the first week. When you try it, the difference will be obvious from the first week. I don't want to give you any incorrect information. Is it stronger than regular toothpaste? Definitely, dear, this is much stronger.

Alright, what is required to complete the order? Okay, dear, I’ve confirmed your order, and now I just need to know your preferred payment method. Is it cash? Would you not prefer to pay through the Tamara application in four installments without any interest? Actually, my credit is finished. It's been a few months now, and I still need to pay it off, so cash will be okay for me. Alright, no problem.

The last thing, on the occasion of the holy month of Ramadan, I have a discount coupon for an additional product. It’s a multi-use brush for easy cleaning of the house or surfaces. It rotates 360 degrees and cleans all tough stains, with 3 different heads. It’s now available for 19 Riyals instead of 90 Riyals. Would you like it to be included with your order? No, no, I just want that product because I have issues with toothpaste. I saw the advertisement, so I contacted you.

Alright, I just want to clarify that I'm working daily, and if the product isn’t 100% right, please advise me not to proceed with the transaction. Certainly, if this product wasn’t suitable, if I noticed any issue, I wouldn’t recommend it to you, since I want your order to be good and for you to be one of our clients.

Alright, dear, we’re done with the order. The product will reach you within one to two business days between 9 AM and 9 PM. We will contact you two hours before. Alright, no problem. If you wish to inquire about anything else, may God bless you. Thank you. Peace be upon you.
