Hello, Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. This is Mohamed from the Order Complications Department. Welcome, brother. I hope you're well. Hi, the occasion has reached my brother Abdullah. I'm not the one who placed the order. I'm not the one who ordered. It's a mistake. My brother Abdullah, yes Abdullah, but I didn't order. Okay, maybe someone from the household or family could have contacted you, and I'll reach out to you again. The order is for the Magic Foam Cleaner that cleans any stain or anything in the house, no matter what it is, even shoes, clothes, anything. No, no, I didn't place the order, it's a mistake. Would you like to inquire and get back to you again? No, no, no, relax. Would you like me to even explain the product to you or clarify anything about it? No, no, I donâ€™t want anything. I'm just busy. All right, relax. Would you like me to even explain the product to you? Thank you.
