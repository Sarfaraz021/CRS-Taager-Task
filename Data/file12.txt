Hello, hello, hello, how are you, my sister? Alhamdulillah, this is Abdullah from the order department. There was an order under my brother's name, Abu Muhammad, for a car scratch remover for magic, priced at 69 riyals. Wrong, wrong. No, sister, wrong, wrong. Aren't you in Casablanca on Al-Nahar Street? No, no, not at all. Okay, I'm sorry then; I reached you at the wrong number. Would you like to benefit from any other product, for example, related to the house, the car, household tools, or personal care? Okay, thank you very much, and sorry again for the inconvenience I caused you today. Yes, yes, goodbye.
