Hello, hi, peace be upon you. Peace be upon you and God’s mercy and blessings. Hi, my brother, how are you? We thank and praise God. God willing, as it unfolds. Welcome, dear. Thank you, I wish you a happy day. This is Nada from the customer service department, confirming the order. I'm contacting you, dear, regarding an order. You were recently with us under the name of my brother Mohammed Saleem Reishaidi. He had ordered the melodious meanings of active meat with a total cost of 110 riyals to your doorstep, dear. Is it correct, dear? I'm waiting for two minutes of your time to confirm the order details. As for me, I told them there's a discount scam and they said no, so I said cancel the order. Wait, dear, my dear, there's a discount. God have mercy on your parents, God have mercy on your parents. Welcome, dear. Hold on with me, the biggest discount I can give you, dear, will be 104 riyals. I'll do everything to get it to your doorstep. It’s certainly a discount, I mean, definitely, but it’s the most I can offer you. If I could, I'd definitely give you more, dear. I'm not repeating myself, dear, approximately. But I want to clarify, dear, that we have many features that are not available anywhere else. I offer you all your rights after receiving the order. I offer you, dear, the highest quality and high-quality materials at a price available nowhere else. Also, you will have direct contact in case there’s any issue with the order by God’s will. You can contact directly through the after-sales service number, which is not available anywhere else. Also, dear, you have a seven-day warranty to return the product. It’s also available through the QR code provided with the order, and you deliver the product, dear, to the responsible delivery company for after-sales services. My dear, my dear, understandably, fine, dear, whatever you want. It's understandable, it's understandable if there’s a small difference. I just want to clarify. Also, it's made of high-quality materials, so I'm giving you value for your money, understand, dear? Goodbye, dear. Any other questions? Take care. Goodbye, dear.
