Hello, peace be upon you. And peace be upon you too. How are you, sister? Hope you're well. Thank God. Guys, this is Abdullah from the Orders Verification and Follow-up Department. I was trying to reach you about an order under the name of my brother Mohammed Al-Mutairee from Boutgared Kashakh. It was about the latest nail clipper with a screen priced at 149 riyals, but it was finished on WhatsApp. What will you take from me on WhatsApp, sister, confirming the order for me? Why did you cancel the order? It's cancelled, and that's it. Okay, can I know why you cancelled it? Your rates are very high abroad, very high. Did you find it on another site, or did you not buy it yet, sister? Did you buy it, meaning did you place an order or not yet? No, no, no, what do you accept? Of course, I can offer you a very good discount, which would be 135 delivered to your doorstep. No, no, it's still very expensive. Okay, sister, it's not expensive relative to the quality that we provide with it and the warranty. No, but it's very expensive, very, very much. I found it for 35 or 15 or 20. No, sister, but that breaks quickly, my sister. It ruins everything. No, no, I tried it once at their place. They have other nice things available, okay? If you'd like to take advantage of it, I can give you a discount to make it 135 without any extra. Thank you. Would you like to benefit from it or any other product whether related to the home, car, household tools that I personally... If you would like to benefit from any other product, I've presented you with the site and its name cash, sister. Okay, I'll see. And there's nothing else. Thank you for your trouble today. Some people are happy.
