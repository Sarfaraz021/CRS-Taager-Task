Nahla: Hello, peace be upon you. 

Ahmed: Peace and mercy of God. Hi, this is Ahmed from your insurance company. Welcome.

Nahla: Thank you. Abdullah was in touch with you regarding an order. The order is for a binocular with two lenses, 40mm, and a field of view of 1000 meters. The cost is 180 riyals, right?

Ahmed: 1000 meters, exactly.

Nahla: What?

Ahmed: Yes, it's 1000 meters.

Nahla: No, excuse me. It was advertised as 3000 and 4000. 

Ahmed: 3000 and 4000? 

Nahla: Yes, that means 3 kilometers and 4 kilometers. 

Ahmed: Okay, I apologize for this mistake. Just to inform you, the area is really suitable, and you can see up to 1000 meters both day and night; it’s very remarkable, even in foggy and rainy times. 

Nahla: No, honestly, I want the 3 kilometers or 4 kilometers, the one mentioned in the advertisement.

Ahmed: I can offer you a discount at 170 riyals instead of 180.

Nahla: No, I want the 3 kilometers or 4 kilometers one, as stated in the advertisement. It was advertised as 4 kilometers.

Ahmed: Well, I apologize for the inconvenience caused. Is there any other product you’d like to benefit from with a discount?

Nahla: No, thank you.

Ahmed: Sorry for annoying you.

Nahla: No problem.
